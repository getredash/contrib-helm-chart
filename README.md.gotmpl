# Redash

{{ template "chart.description" . }}

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Redash](https://github.com/getredash/redash) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

This is a contributed project developed by volunteers and not officially supported by Redash.

Current chart version is `{{ template "chart.version" . }}`

{{ template "chart.sourcesList" . }}

## Prerequisites

- At least 3 GB of RAM available on your cluster
- Kubernetes 1.19+ - chart is tested with latest 3 stable versions
- Helm 3 (Helm 2 depreciated)
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`, add the chart repository:

```bash
$ helm repo add redash https://getredash.github.io/contrib-helm-chart/
```

Create a values file with required secrets (store this securely!):

```bash
$ cat > my-values.yaml <<- EOM
redash:
  cookieSecret: $(openssl rand -base64 32)
  secretKey: $(openssl rand -base64 32)
postgresql:
  auth:
    password: $(openssl rand -base64 32)
redis:
  auth:
    password: $(openssl rand -base64 32)
EOM
```

Install the chart:

```bash
$ helm upgrade --install -f my-values.yaml my-release redash/redash
```

The command deploys Redash on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section and and default [values.yaml](values.yaml) lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```bash
$ helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the Redash chart and their default values.

{{ template "chart.valuesSection" . }}

## Upgrading

- See [the changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for major changes in each release
- The project will use the [semver specification](http://semver.org) for chart version numbers (chart versions will not match Redash versions, since we may need to update the chart more than once for the same Redash release)
- Always back up your database before upgrading!
- Schema migrations will be run automatically after each upgrade

To upgrade a release named `my-release`:

```bash
helm repo update
helm upgrade --reuse-values my-release redash/redash
```

Below are notes on manual configuration changes or steps needed for major chart version updates.

### From 3.0 to 3.1

- Upgraded Redis and PostgreSQL dependency charts, which have new parameters names. Please follow [README.md](./README.md) and official [Redis](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/redis) and [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/postgresql) charts guides.
- Merged workers configuration to simplify their setup:
  - `adhocWorker` => `workers.adhoc`
  - `genericWorker` => `workers.generic`
  - `scheduledWorker` => `workers.scheduled`
  - default config for all workers is at `worker` section
- replaced `hookInstallJob` and `hookUpgradeJob` with `migrations`
- Moved custom entrypoint scripts to [Redash repo](https://github.com/getredash/redash/pull/6674)

### From 2.x to 3.x

- The Redash version is updated from v8 to v10 (v9 never had a stable release)
- The upgrade should be automatic, but please test on a staging environment first!
- There are now additional "genericworker" and "scheduler" deployments, with associated configuration in values.yaml
- 3.x and higher will not run with Redash v8 - if you have overriden the image you will need to update that 
- This chart now requires Kubernetes 1.19+
- Helm 2 is now depreciated and support will be removed in a future version

### From 1.x to 2.x

- There are 3 required secrets (see above) that must now be specified in your release
- The server.env is now depreciated (except for non-standard variables such as PYTHON_*) to allow for better management of Redash configuration and secret values - any existing configuration should be migrated to the new values

### From pre-release to 1.x

- The values.yaml structure has several changes
- The Redash, PostgreSQL and Redis versions have all been updated
- Due to these changes you will likely need to dump the database and reload it into a fresh install
- The chart now has it's own repo: https://getredash.github.io/contrib-helm-chart/
